Data Analysis:
Linear Regression (Simple Predictive Model)
Given that:

* We have historical data (past weekly streams),
* We believe that song growth is steady and predictable (suggesting a linear trend),
* We're comfortable with statistical models like regression but prefer simpler techniques 
  that don't require much computing power.

1. Collect Historical Data: Pull stream numbers from past weeks for each song.
2. Apply Linear Regression: Use the steps above to fit the model with that data.
3. Predict Future Streams: Use the model to predict the streams for the next week or month.
